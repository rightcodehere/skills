## Standalone Mode

If invoked directly (not via the orchestrator), you must first:
1. Read `../rc-codeprobe/shared-preamble.md` for the output contract, execution modes, and constraints.
2. Load applicable reference files from `../rc-codeprobe/references/` based on the project's tech stack.
3. Default to `full` mode unless the user specifies otherwise.

# Architecture & Structure Analyzer

## Domain Scope

This sub-skill detects architectural and structural issues across these categories:

1. **Layer Violations** — Business logic in controllers, presentation logic in models, database access in views
2. **Circular Dependencies** — Direct or transitive circular imports between modules
3. **God Objects** — Oversized files and classes that do too much
4. **Anemic Domain Model** — Entity classes with no behavior, all logic in service classes
5. **Missing Boundaries** — No clear module/domain separation, cross-feature coupling
6. **Directory Structure** — Framework convention violations, flat directory anti-patterns
7. **Config/Environment** — Hardcoded environment values, missing config abstraction

---

## What It Does NOT Flag

- **Small projects/scripts** with fewer than 5 files — flat structure is appropriate for small codebases and adding layers would be over-engineering.
- **Microservices** that intentionally have thin layers — a microservice with a single controller, single service, and single repository is fine by design.
- **Framework-standard monolith patterns** that are idiomatic — e.g., Laravel's default structure for small-to-medium apps, Rails convention-over-configuration patterns, Next.js app directory conventions.
- **Prototypes and proof-of-concept code** clearly marked as such.
- **Generated code directories** (e.g., `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `__pycache__/`).

## Detection Instructions

### Layer Violations

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ARCH` | Controllers containing business logic | Scan files in controller directories (`controllers/`, `Controllers/`, `routes/`, `api/`). Flag controllers that contain: database queries (SQL, ORM query builders beyond simple `find()`/`findById()`), complex conditionals with business rules (3+ branches), calculations, data transformations, or validation logic beyond simple field presence checks. Controllers should delegate to services/actions. | Major |
| `ARCH` | Models/entities containing presentation logic | Scan model/entity files. Flag models that contain: HTML generation, string formatting for display (e.g., `toHtml()`, `formatForDisplay()`), view-specific transformations, CSS class computation, or response formatting. Models should contain domain logic, not presentation. | Major |
| `ARCH` | Views/components calling database directly | Scan view files (`.blade.php`, `.vue`, `.jsx`/`.tsx` components, `.ejs`, `.pug`, Jinja templates). Flag views that contain: direct database queries, ORM calls, raw SQL, or repository method calls. Views should receive data from controllers/props, never fetch it themselves. | Critical |

### Circular Dependencies

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ARCH` | Module A imports B, B imports A (direct or transitive) | Prefer the pre-loaded dependency graph (see "Dependency Graph" subsection below). When present, the graph includes a `circular_dependencies` array with each cycle's full file-path chain — report one `ARCH` finding per cycle with that chain as evidence. When the graph is absent (degraded mode), fall back to tracing import/require/use statements across files and looking for direct cycles (A→B→A) and transitive cycles (A→B→C→A). Focus on module-level (directory-level) cycles which are more architecturally significant than file-level cycles within the same module. | Major |

### Dependency Graph (pre-loaded)

When invoked via `/codeprobe audit` or `/codeprobe architecture`, the orchestrator pre-computes the import graph by running `scripts/dependency_mapper.py` and provides the JSON in-context between `=== DEPENDENCY_GRAPH ===` and `=== END DEPENDENCY_GRAPH ===` markers. The JSON schema:

- `graph`: `{file_path: [files it imports]}` — the full dependency graph.
- `circular_dependencies`: list of cycle objects, each with the full file-path chain (e.g., `["a.py", "b.py", "c.py", "a.py"]`).
- `summary`: `{total_files, total_cycles, most_imported, most_dependencies}` — aggregate stats.

**When the graph is present**, treat it as ground truth: every cycle in `circular_dependencies` becomes an `ARCH` finding. Do NOT attempt your own cycle detection — the script runs deterministic DFS and is more reliable than LLM import-tracing.

**When the graph is absent** (script failed, Python 3 missing, or degraded mode), fall back to LLM-based import tracing as described in the Circular Dependencies row above.

### God Objects

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ARCH` | File exceeds 500 LOC | Count total lines in each source file (excluding blank lines and comments). Flag files exceeding 500 LOC. For files exceeding 1000 LOC, escalate to critical. | Major |
| `ARCH` | Class with 20+ methods | Count public, protected, and private methods in each class. Flag classes with 20+ methods. List the method groups to suggest how the class could be split. | Major |
| `ARCH` | Single file handling request-to-response lifecycle | Look for files that handle the full request lifecycle: receiving/parsing the request, validating input, executing business logic, performing persistence, formatting the response, and logging — all in one file or class. Flag when 4+ of these concerns are in a single file. | Major |

### Anemic Domain Model

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ARCH` | Entity/model classes with only getters/setters, zero behavior | Scan model/entity classes. If a class has only property declarations, getters, setters, and constructor assignment — with no business logic methods (no validation, no calculations, no state transitions, no domain rules) — it is an anemic entity. | Minor |
| `ARCH` | All logic in "Service" classes operating on dumb data bags | Check if the codebase has a pattern where entity classes are pure data containers and all behavior (validation, calculation, state transitions) lives in separate `*Service` classes that manipulate the entity externally. Flag when this pattern is pervasive (3+ services operating on the same entity). | Minor |

### Missing Boundaries

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ARCH` | No clear module/domain separation in medium+ projects | For projects with 20+ source files, check whether the code is organized into modules, domains, or bounded contexts. If all source files live in a single flat directory or are only separated by technical layer (controllers/, models/, services/) with no domain grouping, flag it. | Major |
| `ARCH` | Shared database tables accessed directly across unrelated features | Search for the same database table name, model, or entity being imported/queried from multiple unrelated modules or feature directories. If `users` table is accessed from `billing/`, `notifications/`, `reports/`, and `admin/` without going through a shared `user` module, flag it. | Major |
| `ARCH` | Cross-feature direct imports instead of events/interfaces | Check whether feature modules import directly from other feature modules' internal files. For example, `billing/InvoiceService` importing `shipping/ShippingCalculator` directly instead of through an interface or event system. Flag tight inter-feature coupling. | Minor |

### Directory Structure

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ARCH` | Framework conventions violated | Check whether the project follows its framework's expected directory structure. Examples: business logic classes in a `Controllers/` directory, SQL queries in view templates, route definitions scattered across non-route files, test files mixed with source files without naming convention. | Minor |
| `ARCH` | No separation between layers for 20+ files | For projects with 20+ source files, check whether there is any directory-based separation between layers (controllers, services, models, views) or domains. If everything lives in one flat directory, flag it. | Major |

### Config/Environment

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `ARCH` | Hardcoded environment-specific values in source code | Search for hardcoded URLs (`http://localhost`, `https://api.example.com`), port numbers (`:3000`, `:8080`, `:5432`), hostnames, IP addresses, and file system paths in source code files (not config files). These should come from environment variables or config. | Major |
| `ARCH` | Missing environment abstraction | Check whether the project has an environment abstraction layer (`.env` file + config loader, environment variables, config service). If source files read `process.env.X` or `os.environ['X']` directly in 5+ places without a centralized config module, or if there is no `.env`/config layer at all, flag it. | Minor |

## Using `file_stats.py`

When available, run the file_stats.py script via Bash to get LOC, class count, and method count per file. The script is located in the `review` skill's `scripts/` directory (resolve relative to the skill installation, not the user's project):

```bash
python3 scripts/file_stats.py <target_path>
```

Note: The orchestrator typically runs this script and passes results. If invoked standalone, locate the script in the sibling `codeprobe/scripts/` directory.

Use this data to:
- Identify god objects (files > 500 LOC, classes with 20+ methods)
- Find the largest files in the project
- Get accurate LOC counts for the summary

If Python 3 or the `file_stats.py` script is unavailable, estimate from reading files directly using Read. Do not fail the analysis — proceed with manual counting.

## ID Prefix & Fix Prompt Examples

All findings use the `ARCH-` prefix, numbered sequentially: `ARCH-001`, `ARCH-002`, etc.

### Fix Prompt Examples

- "Move the pricing calculation logic from `OrderController@store` (lines 40-75) into a new `PricingService` class under `app/Services/`. The controller should inject `PricingService` and call `$this->pricingService->calculate($order)`. The controller should only handle request parsing, service delegation, and response formatting."
- "Break `UserManager` (850 LOC) into focused services: extract authentication methods (lines 50-200) into `UserAuthService`, profile management (lines 201-450) into `UserProfileService`, and notification methods (lines 451-700) into `UserNotificationService`. `UserManager` becomes a thin facade that delegates to these three services."
- "Resolve the circular dependency between `billing/InvoiceService` and `shipping/ShippingCalculator`: extract the shared interface `ShippingCostProvider` into a `shared/contracts/` directory. Have `ShippingCalculator` implement `ShippingCostProvider`, and have `InvoiceService` depend on the interface instead of the concrete class."
- "Replace the hardcoded URL `http://localhost:3000/api` at line 23 of `src/services/ApiClient.ts` with an environment variable: use `process.env.API_BASE_URL` loaded through the config module. Add `API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api` to `.env.example`."
- "Create a domain-based directory structure: move `UserController`, `UserService`, `UserRepository`, and `UserPolicy` into a `app/Domains/User/` directory. Repeat for `Order`, `Payment`, and `Notification` domains. Each domain directory should contain its own controllers, services, models, and policies."
