## Standalone Mode

If invoked directly (not via the orchestrator), you must first:
1. Read `../rightcode-codeprobe/shared-preamble.md` for the output contract, execution modes, and constraints.
2. Load applicable reference files from `../rightcode-codeprobe/references/` based on the project's tech stack.
3. Default to `full` mode unless the user specifies otherwise.

# Performance & Scalability Auditor

## Domain Scope

This sub-skill detects performance and scalability issues across these categories:

1. **N+1 Queries** — Lazy-loading relationships inside loops
2. **Missing Indexes** — WHERE/ORDER BY on non-indexed columns
3. **Unbounded Queries** — Model::all() without pagination/limit
4. **Memory** — Loading entire files into memory, array accumulation in loops
5. **Caching** — Repeated identical queries, missing TTL, stale cache after writes
6. **Algorithmic Efficiency** — O(n^2) in hot paths, nested loops, sorting in loops
7. **Concurrency** — Race conditions, non-idempotent queue jobs, shared mutable state
8. **Frontend Performance** — Unnecessary re-renders, bundle size, missing lazy loading

## What It Does NOT Flag

- **Premature optimization in non-hot-path code** — proportional design matters. A utility function called once at startup doesn't need the same optimization as a request handler.
- **Development-only debug queries** — queries in seeders, dev-only commands, or debug endpoints.
- **Batch processing scripts** — scripts intentionally designed to process everything (migrations, data backfills) where unbounded queries may be appropriate.
- **O(n^2) on small bounded collections (<100 items)** — nested loops on small known-size arrays are fine.
- **Frontend SSR/build-time code** — server components and build scripts have different performance profiles than client-side code.

## Detection Instructions

### N+1 Queries

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `PERF` | Eloquent relationship access inside loop without eager loading | Search for `foreach`/`for` loops iterating over a collection, then accessing a relationship property (e.g., `$order->items`, `$user->profile`) inside the loop body. Check whether the query that produced the collection includes `with()` or `load()` for that relationship. | Critical |
| `PERF` | Any ORM lazy-loading inside iteration | Look for patterns where a database query is implicitly triggered inside a loop: Django querysets accessed per-iteration, SQLAlchemy lazy loads, Prisma relation access in `.map()`. | Critical |
| `PERF` | Template/view triggering queries | Blade templates, Jinja2 templates, or React components calling relationship properties that trigger queries during rendering. | Major |

### Missing Indexes

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `PERF` | WHERE/ORDER BY on non-indexed columns | Cross-reference query conditions (`where()`, `orderBy()`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`) with migration files or schema definitions to check for matching indexes. | Major |
| `PERF` | Foreign keys without indexes | Check migration files for `foreignId()`, `foreign()`, `references()` without corresponding index definitions. Most ORMs add these automatically, but raw migrations may miss them. | Minor |
| `PERF` | Composite queries needing compound indexes | Multiple `where()` conditions on different columns in the same query, or `where() + orderBy()` combinations that would benefit from a compound index. | Minor |

### Unbounded Queries

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `PERF` | `Model::all()` or `SELECT *` without limit | Search for `.all()`, `::all()`, `findAll()`, `SELECT * FROM` without `LIMIT`, `paginate()`, `take()`, or `limit()`. | Major |
| `PERF` | Missing cursor/chunk for large dataset processing | Operations that `get()` or load entire collections when processing large datasets. Should use `cursor()`, `chunk()`, `lazy()`, or equivalent streaming approach. | Major |

### Memory

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `PERF` | Loading entire files into memory | `file_get_contents()` on user uploads or large files, `fs.readFileSync()` on variable-size files, Python `open().read()` without size limits. | Major |
| `PERF` | Array accumulation in loops | Arrays that grow inside loops without bounds or cleanup — collecting results in memory that could be streamed or yielded. | Minor |
| `PERF` | Large collections instead of generators | Returning full arrays/lists where generators (`yield`), lazy collections, or iterators would be more memory-efficient for large datasets. | Minor |

### Caching

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `PERF` | Repeated identical queries in same request | Same query pattern executed multiple times within a single request/function call without caching the result. | Minor |
| `PERF` | Cache without TTL | `Cache::put()`, `cache.set()`, Redis SET without expiration. Data cached forever risks staleness. | Minor |
| `PERF` | Cache not invalidated after writes | Write operations (create/update/delete) that don't clear or update related cache entries. Stale cache served after mutation. | Major |

### Algorithmic Efficiency

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `PERF` | O(n^2) or worse in hot paths | Nested loops iterating over the same or related collections. `array_search`/`in_array`/`includes()` inside loops (linear search in a loop = O(n^2)). | Major |
| `PERF` | Sorting inside loops | `sort()`, `usort()`, `array_sort()`, `.sort()` called inside a loop body. | Major |
| `PERF` | Hashmap-replaceable linear search | `in_array()`, `.includes()`, `.indexOf()`, `list.index()` used repeatedly on the same array where building a Set/dict/hashmap first would be O(1) per lookup. | Minor |

### Concurrency

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `PERF` | Race conditions in read-modify-write | Patterns that read a value, modify it, and write back without locking: incrementing counters, updating balances, toggling flags in concurrent contexts. | Critical |
| `PERF` | Queue jobs without idempotency | Queue/job handlers that don't check for duplicate execution. Jobs that create resources without checking if already created. Missing unique constraints on job-created data. | Major |
| `PERF` | Shared mutable state in async contexts | Global/module-level mutable variables accessed in async handlers, request-scoped data stored in module scope. | Major |

### Frontend Performance

| ID Prefix | What to Detect | How to Detect | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `PERF` | Unnecessary re-renders | Missing `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` on expensive computations or components receiving new object/array references on every render. Objects/arrays created inline in JSX props. | Minor |
| `PERF` | Large bundle imports | `import _ from 'lodash'` (imports entire library), `import moment from 'moment'` (large library where `date-fns` or `dayjs` suffice), `import * as icons from 'icon-library'`. | Minor |
| `PERF` | Missing lazy loading | No `React.lazy()` / dynamic `import()` for route-level code splitting. Heavy components loaded eagerly on initial page load. | Minor |

### Optional Script Integration

When `scripts/complexity_scorer.py` output is available (run by the orchestrator during `/codeprobe audit`), use it to identify high-complexity functions as performance hot-spot candidates. Functions rated "high" or "very_high" that also appear in hot paths (request handlers, loop bodies, frequently-called utilities) are strong signals for algorithmic efficiency findings.

## ID Prefix & Fix Prompt Examples

All findings use the `PERF-` prefix, numbered sequentially: `PERF-001`, `PERF-002`, etc.

### Fix Prompt Examples

- "In `OrderController@index` (line 22), add `->with('items', 'customer')` to the `Order::query()` call to fix the N+1 problem — currently loading 2 relations lazily inside the Blade loop at `orders/index.blade.php:15`."
- "Replace `Product::all()` at line 30 of `CatalogService.php` with `Product::query()->paginate(25)` or `Product::cursor()` if processing all records. The current query loads all products into memory."
- "In `ReportGenerator@aggregate` (lines 45-60), the nested loop iterating `$orders` inside `$customers` is O(n*m). Build a lookup hashmap before the outer loop: `$ordersByCustomerId = collect($orders)->groupBy('customer_id')`."
- "Replace `import _ from 'lodash'` at line 3 of `src/utils/helpers.ts` with specific imports: `import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'` to reduce bundle size."
